# GeoportalApp
<p>Uses Google Maps API and JSON data to place markers on the map and edit their info.</p>
<p>There are few bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>when you edit and save markers data and return to map - data not changes. Just change screen orientation or relunch program.</li> <li>MarkerInfo activity uses extra from MainActivity to view markers info. I`l fix that too.</li>
<li><strike>There is mysdfile.txt in project folder. This file must be placed on internal storage for correct working of program.
In future i will fix this moment.</strike> <b>fixed</b></li>
</ul>
Also i will add REST support to this APP after i refactor the main code to the correct appearance and fix all bugs.
