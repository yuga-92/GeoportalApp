# GeoportalApp
Uses Google Maps API and JSON data to place markers on the map and edit their info.


There are 1 bug: when edit and save markers data and return to map - data not changes. Just change screen orientation or relunch program. Activity marker_info uses extra from MainActivity to view markers info. I`l fix that too.
Also i will add REST support to this APP after i refactor the main code to the correct appearance and fix all bugs.


<strike>There is mysdfile.txt in project folder. This file must be placed on internal storage for correct working of program.
In future i will fix this moment.</strike>
